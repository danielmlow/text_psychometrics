      "My friend got a lot skinnier since my ED got worse. Is it my fault?  \n",
      "---\n",
      " In january I relapsed and fell back into my ED. I wont go into detail but after I relapsed I stopped eating in front of my friend, lets call her Lucy. Me and Lucy have been friends for a few years and we mostly hang out with only eachother since we don't really fit in with the rest of the class. She has also always been fairly skinny and has always eaten significantly less than everyone else, but I never noticed any signs of an ED in her. However, since I relapsed i've been skipping lunch in school which also makes Lucy skip lunch since she doesn't want to eat alone. I also started eating more proteinbars and \"health foods\" and stopped buying candy that both me and she loves, and Lucy also started picking up on my habits. I have been recovering and eating a lot more for the past 2 months, and now i'm noticing how skinny Lucy actually looks. I had also been mentioning my workouts infront of her deep in my ED and she started sharing that she regularly runs on the treadmill (she has always expressed how she hates working out). She also just doesn't eat any of her favourite foods anymore like I used to see her doing. I feel so guilty because it feels like i've accidentally influenced her with my ED behaviors, but at the same time now her behaviors trigger me since she never wants to eat. I notice that I feel annoyance towards her because she never eats and makes me fall into my old habits, and honestly we're kind of falling out as friends since we always hung out to eat, but now it feels impossible to do. But I also feel guilt that I might have caused a skinny girl with a small appetite to become even skinner. Is this all my fault? \n",
      "I did it \n",
      "---\n",
      " I finished a meal out. It's been so long. My anxiety caused me to have health issues surrounding my stomach, and it has caused PTSD. I'm afraid to eat and when I do, I run to the bathroom afterwards in fear. Today, I finished a dinner and went nowhere near the bathroom. I didn't know who to share this with, but I'm so happy.\n",
      "How to recognize when you're falling back into bad habits? How to not project onto my kids? \n",
      "---\n",
      " I'm a female, just turned 21. I was diagnosed with anorexia & bulimia at 13. It nearly killed me. I had ups and downs through my teen years, but for the last fours, I've managed to stay healthy and maintain a positive relationship with food and body image. \n",
      "\n",
      "Something I've noticed in the last year or so, though, is that I've started obsessing over clean foods, portions, meal planning, and exercise. These were things that I did pay attention to beforehand, but now it's so bad that I'm dropping weight when I really didn't need to lose any to begin with. I'm not in a dangerous place yet, but I am nearing a point that other people are commenting on how different I look, both positively and negatively. The part that's scaring me is that I enjoy the attention and validation. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have two little girls (3 and 4). They're noticing my habits and the changes in appearance. I've started obsessing over what I'm making and feeding them. Not necessarily portions, but ingredients, and if the food is 'safe' of certain chemicals and artificial things that could be dangerous to their health. They eat well, they're healthy. But I'm terrified that if I don't get this under control now, that I will set an unhealthy example for them, or possibly start to project my fears and delusions onto them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't hate the way I look. I'm not concerned about the size I was before, because I was healthy. Losing weight wasn't even intentional. But I keep reading articles and seeing things about what I'm ingesting, what my kids are ingesting, and it's sent me spiraling down a rabbit hole that inadvertently caused me to lose rapidly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recovery seems so out of reach right now, and I have no idea where to start. The first suggestion is always therapy, but how do I even rationalize to myself that this is a harmful way of living? How do I get over that hurdle of admitting that I can't sustainably continue? I know I can't, and I want to stop, but I can't. \n",
      "Request: my eating has become disordered and i need advice/opinions on how i can fix it! \n",
      "---\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "i was extremely overweight growing up and due to a health condition caused by my weight, i joined WW to shift the weight. i am now a normal weight for my height and i have noticed that (of no fault to WW), my relationship with food has went from one extreme to another.\n",
      "\n",
      "i find that i look forward to eating and am very stringent about when i do so. however i am restricting my calories far too much and i don’t feel comfortable eating anything that’s deemed more than around x points (small #) on WW. i am now far too anxious to eat much and my family have noticed and become extremely pushy and frustrated and are constantly nagging me to eat more. if i try, i just get anxious and have even been brought to tears at how stressed i am at the prospect of eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "i have seen my GP and she has referred me to counseling. however, i feel as if i still need to make changes in the meantime. i cannot afford to see a dietician/nutritionist, so this is my best (and uneducated) bet.\n",
      "\n",
      "i do not feel comfortable coming off any kind of diet/tracking system completely. i have considered coming off of WW entirely and using myfitnesspal to count calories. the main benefit is not considering points when eating may help me eat different things and potentially increase my calorie intake (gradually, of course, as i can imagine my metabolism is too damaged to go up to my TDEE maintainence number so quickly anyway) and along with counselling, may help my damaged relationship with food. when i proposed this to my family, they were very against it due to my success on WW.\n",
      "\n",
      "i was wondering if i could get any external and objective opinions on if this would be a good idea? i am also very open to other suggestions! thank you for reading if you got this far!\n",
      "Request: Do I need to get a doctor involved? \n",
      "---\n",
      " I've been struggling with anorexic tendencies for a few months now, eating extremely few calories in a day. However, I've recently begun to recover with the help of a few close friends. No one else knows what's been going on. At this point, I don't feel physically bad or even all that weak. But I'm worried about the damage I may have caused my body. I was never more than a tiny bit \"underweight\" on the BMI scale, but could my muscles or bones be in trouble even if I feel fine and am eating a normal amount now? Should I see a doctor?\n",

After being discharged (and taken off the injections), i feel like crying everytime i have to eat. I have been calorie counting and have actual anxiety each time i get close to the limit ive put in.

Now I am back and forth from a somewhat healthy lifestyle or all out binge eating at NIGHT only at night. It has been a constant pattern of this since really school started so I contacted my school's mental health center to see if I can talk to a counselor but for now I am stuck constantly thinking about food and craving it. I can go now a few days eating better and then I eat something kinda bad and then eat more that is kinda bad and give up and go full on. Especially now since it's exams week I am extra stressed and take it out on food since it also gives me energy. I feel lost and I am typing this right next to my doordashed mcdonalds hahaha but anyways I was just wondering if anyone else felt this their freshman year and if sophomore year gets any better (since I will be able to cook my own meals and won't be on campus all the time)\n",

Due to lack of funds and a yard, I had to stop working out, and gained weight. My new house never felt like home, and after several months, it still doesn’t. It just feels like camping.

      "That boy suffered from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. ARFID is a more recent discovery among food disorders, being only a few years old, making it a recent addition to the DSM5.\n",
      "\n",
      "ARFID is characterized by an unwillingness to eat anything except for certain \"safe foods.\" People with ARFID come in all shapes and sizes and vary in what their safe foods are and how many they have. For some, ARFID seems to stem from childhood experiences with food, but that doesn't hold true for all. They often blame texture for why they don't like new foods. For someone with ARFID, trying new foods causes great anxiety or even panic attacks. Trying something new comes with the fear of throwing up. It doesn't matter how hungry you are, with ARFID, one will gladly starve instead of eating a non safe food.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the stigma around picky eating, it's often difficult for someone with ARFID to eat out at restaurants or at friends' houses. People try to push eating new things without understanding how difficult ARFID makes it, and if you turn down any offers of food, people become worried or judgemental. People wonder how you can say you don't like a food you've never tried. Sometimes parents who's children have ARFID will force them to try new things or try to wean them off safe foods, but this tends to do more harm than good. More info here: [https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/](https://notapaperjournal.wordpress.com/2019/09/06/arfid-awareness-101/)\n",

Right now, our subreddit is having a mass growth because of the BBC article. Many of us have suffered ARFID all our lives thinking that we were alone, suffering some strange, nameless thing that nobody else has. If you think you or someone you know may be suffering from ARFID, you are not alone.\n",

I am an enemy to myself. I hate it. It is causing me to be even more stressed, but when I am stressed I eat. I eat. And now once again, like the day before, and the day before the previous day and probably for 3 weeks I have been binging. It makes me exhausted. Since 19th december, I have been overeating almost every single day. Painful. It is straining my mental wellbeing, but the worst part of all, when i try not to eat, my body eats. I can't control the hunger, I can't discipline myself the way I did before (during ana). Not only do I hate my body, have a love and hate relationship with food, I also have naturally overthinking and anxiety, which has really gotten worse due to my binging. I honestly am regretting recovering. My anxiety was wayy better when I had ana, but now I am stressed asf and hate myself. I cannot live that way. \n",

I grew to my final height in about a year, which caused me to be hungry CONSTANTLY. I didn't think too much about it because my weight was consistent and I was getting plenty of exercise with school sports. \n",

      "Lots of changes this year. I had just moved to a new place, I went from a small neighborhood to a secluded farm 40 minutes away from town (which I didn't really mind.) A new school, a highschool  where I know absolutely no-one. A house that required almost 100k worth of renovations. And a bipolar mother who had been 3 months without her medication. And a father with extreme anger issues.\n",
      "I cried every day for at least an hour. My parents would constantly scream and swear at each other, my father would break things, I was treated as a glorified punching bag for both of them during the heat of it. I should also mention my anxiety, social anxiety, depression and ADHD (only the depression has been diagnosed professionally.)  Who knew renovations could be so terrifying? I think it gave me ptsd, too. I never liked being yelled at as a child, but these days even a loud laugh from someone makes my hair raise and brings tears to my eyes.   \n",
      "This is when I noticed my eating behaviors. It was always when the house was quiet, like I was terrified a fight would break out any moment. I would eat a lot. Tons. I would stop, get anxious again and then keep eating. Everyday. I think I took to this because it kept my brain and body busy, and the only thing I had to worry about was getting too full. It got much, much worse when highschool actually started. I was too scared to eat my lunch at school (isn't social anxiety the best?) so I would get home and binge for a while, continuing after dinner. Halfway through grade nine, the depression began to creep in. My parents were too busy trying to kill each other to notice I guess, the binging continued. My social anxiety was life threatening at this point. I was scared ALL day, everything made me jump, even walking in the halls. I would shake for the rest of the day after answering a question. I guess all this fear made me more hungry, because I was now binging until the verge of vomiting. I wanted to die. I was going to drown myself in the river at the front of my property, wearing my school bag full of books. One, so it would weigh me down, two, so my parents would know it was school  that pushed me to do it. \n",

I cried more, till I would vomit, my parents finally noticed and took me out of school. I slowed down on my binging and tried using exercise as an escape, and it actually worked. Feeling better now but the other side of depression took its toll on me. I was lazy, grumpy, unmotivated, and emotionless. Halfway through grade 10 and the reno is complete. My parents actually start to patch up their marriage; going to counseling, my mom started new meds and dad tried anger meds.  I am now failing grade 10. I don't want to die but I don't want to live, so I sleep. I go back to school for grade 11 as I have no other choice. Luckily, my depression ironically made me so numb that my social anxiety could not compete anymore. My binging doesn't really occur anymore, I spend most of my time working out. I feel a bit better that summer. My parents are doing ok and I rarely binge, yet I slow down on my exercise and start making tons of desserts and delicious food. I eventually became yyy lbs (just beyond normal weight range) by the start of grade 12.\n",

I still had no control over \"yummy\" foods though; if I over ate I would stay up until 7am the next morning to starve myself.

If I eat things that I do not find symmetrical for a month, I keep on binging on everything I can find for a month and basically destroy my stomach.

      "BED rant: no one talks about binge culture \n",
      "---\n",
      " TL;DR- Binge culture ruined my life and my health, and is ruining the lives of my entire community, but no one is talking about it\n",
      "\n",
      "Binge culture ruined my life. I was born and raised in Texas and I can’t speak for anywhere else but I know that here and in a lot of the USA southern states, bigger is better. That means bigger food portions, bigger clothing sizes, bigger seating, bigger drinks, everything is catered towards larger sizes. I hear about “diet culture” a lot but down here where I live it really doesn’t exist, maybe for certain communities, but for the most part people here revel in constantly binge eating foods that are extremely rich, sickeningly sweet, oily, cheese smothered, hot & spicy, and eating massive portions of them. It is very difficult to find foods that are low in calorie or even any type of specialty food for people with medical conditions or food allergies. Vegans are openly ridiculed and bullied for not eating meat, to the point where even products that are somewhat associated with veganism are openly derided by our STATE LEGISLATORS (see: Ted Cruz’s rant against tofu and soy products, which was extremely ironic considering Texas is one of the largest producers of soy in the entire USA). Gluten free products might take up half a shelf at the grocery store, while there are literally two full aisles just for sodas. When I started at my job, they didn’t have a uniform in my size, but they had plenty of L-3XL uniforms. I had to size up to a medium and it was the only medium they had left. Literally Everyone I know eats out at restaurants or takeout 3-4 times per week, sometimes every single day for lunch, and this is accepted as normal. People who bring their own lunches in to work are seen as weird, even if they can’t afford to eat out with their higher paid colleagues. My friends and coworkers are constantly complaining about their health effects caused by being overweight, but they don’t want to change how/what they eat and they laugh and joke about their previous heart attacks or diagnoses of diabetes as if it’s no big deal. Heart disease is the #1 killer in Texas even though it is highly preventable. The culture has been this way since I was a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the culture that gave me an eating disorder, not diet culture. A binge culture telling me that bigger is better, that eating 2 full sized portions meant to feed 2 people can and should be eaten just by me, in one sitting, and that that is “treating myself”. A capitalist culture telling me to buy and consume as much as possible, because that will make me happy. A culture blasting advertisements in my eyes and ears everywhere I look, telling me this new food product is what is going to make me happy, even if it’s just for a few minutes. A culture that has normalized eating 3 servings of ice cream in one sitting as a way to ‘help’ you when you are sad. A culture that has massive potlucks at church every Sunday and has normalized the sensation of eating 3 full plates or more until you are uncomfortably full, even to the point of damaging your stomach. This is binge culture. This is normal in my community, and it’s devastating it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Binge culture is just as insidious as diet culture, even more so in fact, because the binge culture is supported and subsidized by the massive corn industry(which is in EVERYTHING- corn syrup, corn starch, even things like citric acid, that’s from corn too!), the 528 billion dollar fast food industry, the \\~200 billion dollar soda industry, and the \\~105 billion dollar chocolate industry (which relies heavily on CHILD SLAVERY! See Nestles 2014 labor report in West Africa). Compare that to the \\~72 billion dollar diet industry (and that’s generous) and tell me which culture is more influential. Here in Texas the winner is clear. The only reason diet culture even exists in the first place is because of these highly influential and powerful food industries that have messed up the way that people are meant to intuitively eat, which is not possible in an artificial environment where people are constantly bombarded with food and images of food that are artificially engineered to be hyper palatable, visually pleasing, unsatiating, physically addicting, and constantly available wherever you go. THIS is why I developed BED. Not because of diet culture, but because binge culture is so accepted and normalized where I live that it is seen as the norm. I know this sub caters more towards restrictive eating disorders, but BED is just as valid of a disorder as AN, and us folks struggling with BED deserve to be heard. I struggle with extremely disordered binge eating, but I don’t feel like I can find support among some of these subs because they often facilitate the binge culture mindset and trigger me into bingeing. Sentiments like “restriction always leads to a binge” make my mind say “well you might as well just binge and not even try because any form of self control = restriction I guess”. Sentiments like “if you refuse any food offered to you at all that is restriction and that is a Disordered Mindset” being touted as ‘recovery progress’, when for me, the inability to refuse food is a hallmark of the BED mindset. This is not helpful to me and other BED sufferers and is actually enabling my form of eating disorder, which is ironic for a sub that claims to be for only pro-recovery. I just wish I could find the support of like minded people who have suffered the way I have because of the way we were raised.\n",

Not all anorexics are so severly underweight that they are close to death by starvation. From what i researched dying from starvation itself is rare but rather comes from medical issues caused by malnutrion or heart complications. So if the BMI is inacurate,anorexia becomes harder to treat the longer it goes on,then why do medical professional ' wait'( no pun intented) until someone comes into treatment when the have a low BMI or are at critical condition? Wouldn't it make more sense to diagnose and treat an illness BEFORE it seriously damages the body,or its so entrenched its untreatable? Are people only consodered \" sick\" enough to get treatment once they become as thin as Eugenia Cooney for exsample?Also what causes binge eating in some anorexic people and turn it into bulemia nervosa and not in others who remain restrictive/caloroe cautious in their ED.

      " Hello all!\n",
      "\n",
      "I (22F), grew up with an eating disorder in my teenage years (13-18), and I was a late bloomer. I would not eat anything healthy when I did eat (candy, desserts, and chips type of things) because I was never taught the importance of healthy eating, and I was very malnourished I was anemic and had low thyroid and I am sure other issues but I never would eat healthy at all never vegetables. I did not value sleep and was very stressed . This caused me to have stunted growth, and doctors can tell you it is stunted because I have had a bone test and was growing VERY slow.  I had very toxic friends and other people around me, they would bully about my height a lot (it took me till I was 15 and a half till I was 5 foot, and 16 and a half till I was 5 foot 1. I didnt finish growing till I was about 17 and a half and stopped at 5 foot 2). But the teasing was what caused my eating disorder in the first place because they would make me feel so worthless it was like I needed control of something/ I was so worried they would make fun of my weight. Its hard because my proportions are completely different from when I was younger, and it makes me look very young and I feel less attractive and it makes me so mad because I never recovered because of my friends being so mean. I originally got the eating disorder from gymnastics but I quit gymnastics to recover and that was when my friends and some boys at church started to be really mean and full on triggered it again. It really disgusts me how I lived my life and I always felt so hungry constantly and would go very long without eating some times. But because of my lack of nutrients and how long i would go without eating i would go without eating, my metabolism was very slow and i tend to gain weight from sugar very easily so i wasnt very skinny but i would also binge eat sugar. I was also on medication that causes me to gain weight a lot. It is also hard because I tell some people about the stunted growth and they dont believe me but it would not be possible, literally according to the doctor for me to not have stunted growth and i was truely very malnourished, and people were very worried about my growth. I also am sure that it stunted my body growth such as my boob growth as well as hip growth or any type of growth that would happen at that time, and people would always make fun of my boobs as well for being flat though they have grown a little bit but it just makes me so angry that they would be so hurtful to me, and I never told anyone I had an eating disorder but I feel like its just common sense to not make fun of other peoples appearance.\n",

For context she has these regular spiral episodes where she will cry extremely loudly, or scream the house down for at least an hour, usually because she dislikes the dinner my parents have made her or just in general about her ED. In these spirals she often gets suicidal and says some pretty depressing things to hear from someone I love such as she ‘wants to be someone else’ or that she ‘doesn’t want to be here anymore’ repeatedly. \n",

She was in such a bad state when she got diagnosed that she was told she was a couple weeks away from heart failure, had to not go to school for the foreseeable future, and eat 3 meals and 2 snacks a day. Her hair was also (and still is) falling out, and she’s always ice cold. Ever since being diagnosed she has to go to the clinic around once every two weeks and she hates it there. She’s started locking herself in bathrooms  when meant to be in progress meetings, yelling at the doctors there and storming out of the building. She’s even knocked over some chairs in her rage, which caused them to worry and increase the amount of times she has to see them each week which has only increased her frustration. \n",

So I go on these binges where I don’t eat and just do Coca Cola for a week straight just to lose weight and I LOVE being told I look thinner ! I love it so much. But I feel the guilt everytime. In just 4 months I went from 250 to 160. Dropped almost 100lbs but that was the worst time. Although I felt hotter and happier than ever, I wasn’t healthy. I wa literally dying. That was gram to two every day, and eating only watermelon to continually poop all the water weight out. Is this considered an ED? Or is this just an addiction? I do consider ED as an addiction, it’s an addiction to your appearance which is caused by dysmorphia…but I’m not sure if I should fall down the therapy rabbit hole for an ED.\n",

      " I’ve always hated my body. Ever since I was a child, I was the chubby one, the baby who ate a lot, the kid who got teased for it. My family never meant harm, but their words stuck with me. As I got older, I became hyper-aware of my body, constantly comparing myself to others. By the time I reached high school, those thoughts had settled in, whispering that I wasn’t good enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, I carried that self-hatred, but it wasn’t until five years later that I finally acted on it. I started restricting strictly, with purpose. I had always hated my thighs, my bottom, the way my body carried weight, even though I was at a “normal” weight. I told myself that if I just lost enough, maybe I’d finally feel okay. And I did lose quite a lot of weight. \n",
      "\n",
      "But before I could fully sink into it, I was forced into early recovery. My parents made a deal with me: if I wanted to go back to univ, I had to get back on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I ate. I regained some weight. But the thoughts never left. I still restricted at times, still found comfort in emptiness. I liked that feeling, of being light, of not needing anything. I exercised at home, but mostly, I walked a lot. Anything to keep the guilt away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I’ve been all-in for a week. Completely honest with myself. No more pretending. And I’m scared. My digestion is a mess, my stomach feels sluggish, and it’s like I’m reliving the first time I tried to recover. \n",
      "\n",
      "I made the mistake of looking back at old pictures. Pictures of me before the restriction, before I lost the weight. And I hated what I saw. I felt disgusted. I know I was never overweight, I know logically that my body was “fine”, but I still can’t stand looking at those images. I prefer my body after restriction, even after everything it put me through. Even knowing how much pain it caused me, I still struggle to let it go. And I don’t know how to change that.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it’s not just my body that haunts me. It’s my past. The life I had before all of this. The way I used to eat, how I actually enjoyed food, how it used to be something that made me happy. The people I was surrounded by …\n",
      "\n",
      "And now, looking back, it feels like I can’t recognize that person. It’s almost like I’m traumatized by it. But the truth is, I wasn’t totally unaware back then. I did have thoughts about my body and food, but they were quieter …\n",

My ED has been harder to deal with. People say once an addict always an addict, but I think once an anorexic/bullimic always an anorexic/bullimic. But, for the most partt, I was doing well. I was confident in myself and ate well and took care of myself. However, something to note, I am a “curvy” person. Antipsychotics took their toll on my body and I’ve come to terms with this and I was confident in my figure. I even could go to the gym without it feeling TOO problematic. \n",

I asked him to stop and said I hated him always pointing out my body and how big I was, even in the sense of being tall, but so many times he would tell me how broad and tall I am or would squeeze my arms ans say how they were soft and had no muscle. I became so aware of my body in ways I hadn’t in years. Of the space I took up. I’d never through or myself as broad before but suddenly I saw myself as big and different and unsightly in a way that was new to me. It was awful.

I told my parents what I had noticed, and then they put her into therapy and pulled her out of her dance classes, which has been making her absolutely miserable. She knows that I'm the one who said something and is pissed about it. I feel awful that I caused her to get pulled out of dance, but I do want her to get the help she needs. But it's hard to deal with my sister hating me. I know, it's the eating disorder talking, not her, but a lot of it is still coming out of her mouth and I hate having to hear that from my sister.

      "“But there are people with EDs who developed them to be pretty, or because they’re fatphobic!” Sure. But here’s the thing: the vast majority of people don’t feel attractive enough at some point in their life. There are (unfortunately) many fatphobic people in the world. *And yet the overwhelming majority of these people don’t develop debilitating, lethal disorders because of it.* A mentally healthy person does not deal with those feelings by restricting or purging. Getting rid of fatphobia or beauty standards is not going to fix what the people who developed EDs for that reason were struggling with before their ED. \n",

This leaves many people with inadequate resources for recovery, when so much of it is focused on loving your body with little attention to other factors. It also doesn’t take into account that even for people whose main reason is to fit beauty standards, mentally healthy people don’t respond to not fitting beauty standards by starving themselves or purging. 99.99% of the time there are underlying factors or mental health issues involved too that wouldn’t be cured by stopping beauty standards, and those are important to address in recovery as well.”\n",

      " hello. So, my problem started developing when I was a young child, (I’m not diagnosed because I have never told anyone about my mental health, but I’m certain this is an eating disorder) basically, my family grew up very very poor, so we rarely had any food in the house. This situation did get better over time and a few years before I was a teen, we had food pretty much all the time. But we were still going through a lot of drama/trauma, and several family deaths. So, i ate. I guess it was comforting thinking “atleast I have food”.  I started gaining and it caused horrible bullying, but I couldn’t stop eating because it gave me comfort. So I started purging. This quickly resulted in my binging severely when I had any kind of stress/ any other kind of emotion that I didn’t like. So I would binge and purge several times in a single day, then I started restricting so I wouldn’t gain, then I got scared that I couldn’t have food so I would binge again and just start the cycle over again. I’m an adult now in my own place, and unfortunately still struggling. Not as badly, but it’s clearly still a problem. Anytime I have even a minor argument with anyone, someone is sick, something going on at my school, something at work, my immediate reaction is binge and purge. Again. I hate myself for it,  but I still can’t stop. I’ve tried everything I can think of but I always end up back in that horrible place that I just have to. I hate myself. I have to stop this. Please help me stop.\n",

I compiled the following information to pass along to her and thought it might be of service to this subreddit. I hope it brings some insight!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a post I shared on social media a few years ago to summarize my journey:\n",
      "\n",
      "I debated sharing this post for a long time so please read with an open heart and mind. For years, I hated and was very concerned about my body size and shape. I went on restrictive diets, religiously counted calories and steps, compulsively over-exercised, measured everything I ate, always ordered ridiculous substitutions at restaurants, and would often binge while drinking, stressed, or starving in secret. Even at my lowest weight (nutrient deficient, bones visible, hair loss), I still hated my body and thought I could be thinner. From then on, I almost always felt fat. It is possible to have an extremely distorted self image. It took me years to hit “diet rock bottom” where I knew I needed help and have since been on my recovery journey. At first, I was terrified to let myself eat whatever I wanted. I thought I’d never stop eating and could never trust my body to know what it needed. Learning to intuitively eat is a process but it is so well worth the effort! Having stabilized my weight near my natural “set point”, I am no longer constantly starving, obsessing over food/calories/workouts, and I am so much more in tune with what my body truly needs. Diets and health culture teach us to lose touch with our body’s innate wisdom. Disordered eating comes in many forms as eating struggles and body dysmorphia affect most people (Some stats say >70% of us have some form of disordered eating) yet we seldom talk about it. The aim of this post is to share my story in hopes of helping others reexamine their relationships to food and body. I know how painful food struggles and body dissatisfaction can be and am now a huge advocate for self acceptance and rebellion against the weight loss/fitness industry and beauty ideal. We are so much more than our bodies. If any of this resonates with you, I highly suggest looking into the Food Psych Podcast, the book Intuitive Eating by Tribole/Resch, cleansing your Instagram of accounts that make you feel bad about yourself, and starting a journaling practice. \\~\\~\\~\\~\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional reflections on what I've learned over the last 4+ years in Recovery: We live in a society that normalizes disordered eating. I used to think that either you have an eating disorder (i.e full blown anorexia or bulimia) or you are normal. When in reality, disordered eating exists on a spectrum. SO SO SO so many women (and increasingly more men) have disordered relationships to food and their body. We learn it from our mothers, friends, and the culture at large. Many women, nutritionists, doctors, and athletes have become aware of the constructed set of beliefs, norms, and practices that is referred to as “diet culture”. Examples of diet culture are: the idea that certain foods are “bad or good” or “clean or dirty” or the classic “vacation calories don’t count” or “I better be running xx miles tomorrow after this meal”, etc. The guilt and shame that is associated with allowing oneself to eat is one of the major effects of diet culture. Diet culture can be easily seen in fitness and weight loss industries but is also sneakily hidden in the general health and wellness industry. It’s a tricky realm to navigate because obviously we care about our health, but adopting diet culture’s norms and the “diet mentality” is ultimately detrimental to our health, even if it looks like making healthy choices in the short term. (More on this later.)\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to heal from my own journey of disordered eating, chronic dieting, compulsive over exercising, and loathing my body, I dove deep into understanding the physical and psychological underworkings of my experience. It led to a massive perspective shift and profound learning around our current society, social norms, our biological needs, true self care, holistic health, and more. I have read multiple books on the topic and have listened to hundreds of hours of podcast interviews and stories with dietitians, nutritionists, psychologists, research scientists, social activists, and people in larger bodies who have been through astoundingly painful weight loss attempts and abuse from doctors/practitioners. But most importantly, I’ve lived it. I first handedly experienced the process of going from chronically dieting and hating my body to intuitively choosing foods that feel supportive in each moment, eating for the purpose of satisfaction and self care, and trusting and loving my body more than I could have ever imagined. I can confidently say that today, approximately 4.5 years after deciding I didn’t want to live my life obsessing over food, body concerns, and exercise, my relationship to food and my body is SO different. I never thought it could be so easeful and fulfilling. There is so much to learn but I can try to distill down some core facets that have really served my recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Intuitive eating:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* This has been the most important resource for healing my relationship to food. The concept of intuitive eating was coined by 2 dietitians, and is outlined in a seminal book: Intuitive Eating, [https://www.intuitiveeating.org/](https://www.intuitiveeating.org/), the newest addition is now out and I fully recommend the accompanying workbook - Intuitive eating is a direct response to the failure of dieting. Ultimately, you’ll learn in the book that statistically speaking, diets don't work. They may deliver short term weight loss but the majority of people regain the initial weight plus MORE weight. Numerous studies have found that in general, diets result in long term weight GAIN rather than loss. This is because the body is protecting itself from famine. It’s a biological instinct to hold onto nutrients when they are restricted.\n",
      "* Intuitive eating is how our bodies were designed. It’s based around identifying hunger and fullness cues, feeling into our cravings, desires, satisfaction, and practicing attunement and acceptance. It’s a practice so there will be times when you feel like you made a mistake (i.e. overeat and it will hurt, under eat and get way too hungry and maybe overeat), but that is where the acceptance part comes in. Practice self compassion, move on and try better next time! You're completely unlearning old diet behaviors/rules and learning a whole new way of living and being in your body. It takes time but it gets easier and easier and ultimately you don't even really have to think about it, it becomes so natural. Also, Intuitive Eating is not a tool for weight loss nor is it the \"hunger and fullness diet\" where you only are \"allowed\" to eat when hungry. THERE ARE NO RULES in intuitive eating. It is a personal practice based on developing an intimate relationship with your body.\n",
      "* Trust is key. It’s really scary to trust your body at first. Especially if you’ve been in the diet mentality for a long time. Trust gets easier the more you practice it. And it’s so worth it.\n",
      "* Binge/Restrict cycling: This was a major lightbulb for me. I used to restrict foods physically (e.g. restricting # of calories/day or avoiding sugar). Physical restriction triggers a biological craving for what is restricted. It’s within our DNA to avoid famine as was advantageous for so many of our ancestors to survive. Our bodies are created to sustain themselves. A diet is nothing more than a simulated famine. When certain food groups or nutrients in general are restricted, the body responds with intense cravings that ultimately result in binging. Out of control eating that feels scary, wrong, and shameful. My binge sessions were often triggered by stress or being drunk. Following a binge episode, we often then are very ashamed and freaked out about the amount consumed. This often leads to further restriction and the cycle continues. I lived this cycle for years.\n",
      "* We can also restrict foods mentally. It’s a little trickier to understand but mental restriction is when you are telling yourself you “shouldn't” or “can’t” eat certain foods. The “good vs bad” and “clean vs dirty” food labeling are examples of mental restriction. Even if you are not physically restricting by outwardly being on a diet, mental restriction also can trigger the primal binge response. Our bodies are smarter than our minds. It’s against our biology to be denied nutrients, pleasure, and the social bonding of certain food rituals such as birthday cake or thanksgiving dinner.\n",
      "* There is also the “last supper mentality” which is when you are planning to go on a diet (such as a no sugar diet or all veggie cleanse) but you have some time before starting. It’s common that your cravings will be out of control as your body tries to get as much of that food group in as it can before being restricted.\n",
      "* Other Intuitive eating resources: Christy Harrison's Intuitive Eating Fundamentals Course (here), Isabel Foxen Duke's Stop Fighting Food (here), or the Fuck It Diet (here).\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "**Joyful Movement:** \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to approach movement as “working out” or “exercise”. Constantly counting my calories, distance, pace, and progress. In healing your relationship to food and body, it’s often recommended to reconsider your movement choices. I stopped running and doing pilates for 3+ years since those types of movement did not feel supportive for my healing. Instead, I explored ways of moving that truly felt good in my body and I approached them with no expectations of caloric exertion, etc. - Yoga, rock climbing, nature walks, and tribal fusion belly dancing are all forms of movement that make me feel embodied, joyful, and mentally refreshed. My body feels celebrated instead of punished. I also approach movement intuitively, and never force myself to do any type or amount of movement that doesn’t feel like it will serve me. I embrace rest, especially on certain days of my monthly cycle, and I feel so much more in tune with my body's needs. - There have been challenging moments where life gets so busy that there is no/little time for joyful movement. These are times when my recovery is challenged and I get to deepen my practice of acceptance, trust, and letting go of expectations. Life is very cyclical and there will always be time to regularly move again. Time for movement is a privilege that so many people do not have. I’m so grateful when time allows for joyful movement but I do not punish myself or feel guilty when I do not have the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Body Image:**  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "* Health at Every Size:\n",
      "   * Health at Every Size (HAES) is a newly emerging concept with substantial scientific evidence to support it. In short, it is the idea that one’s body size does not indicate one’s health. Or rather, that people in larger bodies can be completely healthy even if considered “overweight”. Or that thinner does not necessarily equal healthier. (This is not to say that all people in larger bodies are healthy). You can learn about HAES at the website (here).\n",
      "* It's virtually impossible to live in western society without some form of body image struggles. Working on body image and reversing fat-phobia are KEY in healing. Whenever I have a body conscious/bad body image thought, I try to recognize it as a \"negative body image thought\" and respond with something like \"I am not my body\" or \"my body does not define me\" or \"my body is my vessel\" or \"the shape of my body does not matter\" or \"all bodies are worthy of love\"... I’d recommend finding some little mantras that resonate with you. Try following fat-positive social media accounts (models, athletes, influencers, etc.) that are actively celebrating diverse body types and people in larger bodies. This will help with restructuring your mindset to be less fat-phobic.\n",
      "* We live in a society/economy that glorifies a body type that only a small fraction of the female population naturally has. Capitalism media/marketing has insidious psychological tactics to make you hate your body and fear being \"fat\" in order to SELL YOU THINGS (diets, exercise products, beauty products, clothes, the list goes on)! They profit off of self hatred that they instill within us - It's truly evil. We must remember that \"modern\" times are only a glimpse of human history. Women in larger bodies have been worshiped for millennia by other cultures since they saw the full feminine form as a sign of fertility, beauty, and prosperity. Try to remember that we have all been subconsciously programmed by social construction, media, and marketing to fear the fat on our bodies. There is truly NOTHING wrong with your body no matter what size it is. Journaling down these reminders and self affirmations to encourage body acceptance will help restructure your mindset. It is totally possible to create new neural networks (brain connections = thought patterns) and overcome the root cause of your struggles!\n",

      "* Healing from having a disordered relationship to food and body is so much more than just addressing the food and body relationship. There is almost always an underlying issue or set of issues that is driving the disordered behaviors. Yes, living in diet culture and fatphobia are main factors, but other factors contribute significantly. Some examples of underlying causes are: trauma (emotional, physical, etc.), unworthiness, low self esteem, perfectionism, needing to have control, escapism, self harm, etc.\n",
      "* For me, my disordered eating was caused by low self esteem, unworthiness, perfectionism, and the need to have control. When life gets stressful and overwhelming, it’s an instinct to grasp for control of something. Controlling one's food and body is an accessible option. - Prioritizing self care practices that support us is key! Ways to healthily manage stress, overcome trauma, heal unworthiness wounds, and increase self love and self acceptance are CRUCIAL to healing the root causes. Joyful movement is one of these practices but others are: journaling, talk therapy, art therapy, women's circles, reading, dance, yoga, singing, sound healing, reiki, acupuncture, creativity (art, writing, etc). A book that is often recommended is the Artist's Way. One of the practices in the book is a 30 minute journaling session first thing in the morning. Stream of consciousness, brain dump on to paper. This was amazingly transformative for me. My writing sessions often consisted of me unpacking my stresses and body concerns, and reassuring myself with positive affirmations.\n",
      "* So I highly recommend journaling! Journal your thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. Practice self compassion, let yourself cry if you need to, and most of all FORGIVE yourself. We are not perfect and we are always learning. Forgiveness is huge. Explore other creativity, explore expression through dance, song, colors, cooking, whatever calls to you!

      " I'm a 14 almost 15 year old trans male. I have ARFID and have for as long as I remember but sadly my parents don't believe me. I was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (not caused by lifestyle) and I don't have an insulin pump yet so i have to take injections through an insulin pen or syringe. I really hate having to have injections just to eat or drink most things so I've ended up not eating nearly as much and cutting my meals in half to take less insulin and not have to inject myself so I've started eating much less than I should, what can I do to help myself with eating regularly again and help myself with ARFID?\n",

      " a few months ago i was on vyvanse and had an ed that caused me to noticeably loose weight, i did end up having to gain it all back before switching meds. at the start of the year i started taking two 4hr ritalin tablets a day which barely did anything. anyways for the past 3 ish weeks ive been on one higher dose 8hr ritalin tablet a day along with some unrelated meds, about a week or two ago i was noticing that it was suppressing my hunger. i started forgetting i was hungry and eating food suddenly seemed very unappetising, as im still a teen my dad has seen a difference in my weight already and is worried im going to be sick even though i have a good relationship with food. he's recently been offering to buy or make anything i want for dinner (healthy or unhealthy) and he usually sits in my room , if i dont eat enoigh or take too long he tells me to keep eating. hes also started to offer dropping off fast food or anything during lunch at school in hopes that ill eat more. now i have nothing wrong with eating but on these meds i physically cant and i have no idea what to do if anyone has any sort of suggestions please let me know\n",

      "I’ve been meaning to make a post about my period recovery forever. so for a little background, I lost my period back in 2018 (11th grade) by losing around loads of weight over a few months, over exercising, never sleeping, and extreme stress, etc. etc. I had lost it once or twice in middle school as well, but always got it back because I started eating normally again after a few weeks. My ED began in elementary school mainly because I went to school in Japan, where everyone was half my size and I became the thick Blasian girl bullied and harassed for my body. I wasn’t even “overweight” but it did a lot of damage. There was also a part of me that wanted to be smaller because many older students and older men would approach me simply because of my body type. I wanted to be the dainty girl that was seen as feminine and girlfriend material not a quick “****”. \n",
      "\n",
      "After my big weight loss in 2018, I maintained an unhealthy low weight until 2022. Half of my hair fell out, my nails cracked off, losing my virginity and every sexual encounter afterward caused abnormal bleeding (no estrogen), I didn’t go out with people, I counted every single calorie, and my life was absolutely miserable. \n",
      "\n",
      "In late 2023 I finally started to try to get my period back. I had tried a few times before, but always given up if I gained over X pounds and would relapse again. But this time was different. While I was already semi-recovered, and had gained some weight/ eating more, I knew that if I wanted to have a family day and have a fully functioning body, I would have to go all in with recovery. Here is what I did. \n",
      "\n",
      "What I did: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Began eating double calories every single day. \n",
      "- Quit all exercise except for light walks 5 times a week and never counting steps. \n",
      "- Increased fat intake significantly (yogurt, full fat, cottage cheese, almonds, peanut butter, avocado, etc.)\n",
      "- Ate meals people cooked for me if I was hungry. \n",
      "- For me, going all in didn’t mean just eating junk food, but I ate a lot of nutritious foods that were high in calories, and finally allowed myself to indulge, sometimes in suites that I loved. \n",
      "- Slept 7-8 hours a night at LEAST.\n",
      "- Ate breakfast within 30 minutes - 1 hr of waking up (this is actually so important. I had a developed a habit of hoarding calories until 3 PM or even later so that I could go to sleep without starving.) my body began to trust that I would feed it consistently. \n",
      "- Ate every 3-4 hours. For me, that looked like: Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, dessert. \n",
      "- Hired a nutritionist/ therapist to give me reassurance. This isn’t necessary especially if you do everything above but for me, it was because I was so freaking terrified of gaining weight and needed someone to be constantly telling me that I wasn’t going to become 5 times my size and that to what I was doing would work. That reassurance was 80% of my recovery.\n",

      "- I started this regimen mid November 2023. \n",
      "- I got my period back almost exactly 4 months after I started. I gained about some weight but I still look pretty IMO :P\n",
      "- My first period was pretty light. 2 light days and 2 medium days. my second period came around 40 days after my first and it was a bit heavier. The next one came around 28 days after and was a bit heavier again. After three periods, I reduced my calories slowly to be enough to keep me full rather than painfully full and bloated. I also slowly started to add in light workouts again (yoga, Pilates, etc.) but very slowly. With each cycle I either added a day or increase the intensity for one workout to make sure I never lost my period again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you are reading this, you probably struggle with heating, body image, issues, or exercise. I understand you and your struggles with getting your period back are valid. For me, the most difficult part was the weight gain, and they not knowing how much weight I would have to gain or if I would ever actually get my period back. If you’ve noticed that you lost your period when you made a lifestyle changes, it is extremely likely that the steps I talked about above will help you get it back. You gotta do what you gotta do and you will come out stronger. Everyone who loves you will still love you and think you are beautiful. Health is beautiful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue for me was that I was scared that my boyfriend was going to immediately break up with me because I met him when I was skinny. I was convinced that I would look completely different to him after gaining lots. To avoid him randomly breaking up with me, in November I told him I would have to gain weight + opened up about my whole ED history. I also showed him a picture of before I lost weight so he would know what to expect. He held me and said “this changes nothing.” That really really helped me commit. And guess what he was being honest. He still treats me the same as the day we met. Remember, no one that actually matters will ever care about you, exercising less or eating more to improve your health. we are conditioned to think more movement less food and a smaller body is the goal. But that is BS! XoXO\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, I am definitely not as skinny as I was, but I am stronger,  I am nicer, my skin is glowing my hair is bouncy with curls that run down my back. Sure, I don’t have a thigh gap and sometimes there’s a little flap under my bra and the back but life has color again. I can have a family if I want to. I have enough energy to dedicate my brain space to loving the people I love enjoying good food and working on my hobbies. It was so worth it and if you’re struggling with this, I promise you will be okay. \n",
